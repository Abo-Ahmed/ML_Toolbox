# ArmorNet: Transformer Network for Pornography Classification in Animated Cartoons

## Overview
ArmorNet is a specialized deep learning neural network designed for automatically categorizing nudity features and private body parts in animated cartoons to effectively filter pornographic elements. This transformer network model is tailored to function efficiently on low-resource devices like mobile phones and video game consoles, emphasizing a lightweight structure while maximizing classification accuracy.

## Features
- Utilizes transformer network architecture for precise classification of explicit content in animated cartoons
- Designed to categorize animated cartoons intended for children, with a focus on nudity modality
- Versatile and extendable methodology for filtering various types of sensitive content
- Comparative analysis with traditional classifiers like ResNet for performance evaluation
